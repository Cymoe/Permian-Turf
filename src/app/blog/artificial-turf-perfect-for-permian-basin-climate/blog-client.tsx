              <strong>The Permian Basin faces extreme drought conditions that make water-free landscaping 
              not just a luxury, but a necessity.</strong> With severe water restrictions, persistent drought, and 
              scorching heat, maintaining traditional grass lawns has become both expensive and impossible 
              without massive water waste.
            </p>

            <h2>The Reality of Permian Basin Drought Conditions</h2>
            
            <p>
              Midland and Odessa are experiencing unprecedented drought severity. With temperatures exceeding 
              100°F for months and less than 15 inches of annual rainfall, natural grass cannot survive without 
              excessive irrigation. Water-free landscaping is the only sustainable solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2023 alone, the drought-stricken region experienced:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>87 days with temperatures above 95°F</li>
              <li>Only 11.2 inches of total rainfall (worst drought in 50 years)</li>
              <li>Stage 4 water restrictions for 6 months</li>
              <li>Average water bills increased by 35% due to drought surcharges</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Natural Grass Fails in Drought Conditions</h2>
            
            <p>
              Natural grass requires 55 inches of water annually. With Permian Basin drought delivering 
              just 20% of that, property owners face impossible choices. Drought-resistant turf eliminates 
              this problem entirely with zero water usage.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Extreme Water Waste:</strong> A 5,000 sq ft lawn consumes 
              125,000 gallons annually during drought</li>
              <li><strong>Drought Damage Costs:</strong> Constant reseeding and replacement 
              averages $500/month</li>
              <li><strong>Water Restrictions:</strong> Stage 4 drought restrictions prohibit 
              most irrigation</li>
              <li><strong>Failed Irrigation:</strong> Drought causes system failures and 
              mineral buildup</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Water-Free Landscaping: The Drought Solution</h2>
            
            <p>
              Modern drought-resistant artificial turf technology specifically addresses Permian Basin 
              water challenges. Our water-free landscaping products offer:
            </p>

            <h3>1. 100% Water-Free Operation</h3>
            <p>
              Once installed, drought-resistant turf requires zero irrigation forever. For typical 
              Midland properties, this means saving $3,000-5,000 annually on drought water rates 
              while maintaining beautiful green spaces.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Extreme Drought & Heat Resistance</h3>
            <p>
              Our UV-stabilized drought-resistant turf thrives in 110°F heat without any water. 
              While natural grass burns and dies in drought conditions, water-free landscaping 
              stays pristine year-round.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Dust Storm & Wind Resistance</h3>
            <p>
              Properly installed water-free turf withstands Permian Basin dust storms. The permeable 
              backing prevents dust accumulation while requiring zero water for cleaning - perfect 
              for drought conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Permanent Drought Solution</h3>
            <p>
              While neighbors struggle with dead grass from drought, your water-free landscaping 
              maintains perfect appearance without irrigation. Essential for commercial properties 
              and oil field housing during water restrictions.
            </p>

            <h2>Drought Cost Comparison: Water-Free vs Traditional</h2>
            
            <p>
